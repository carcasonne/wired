# todo stuff
- Should send signals to the media player on linux. So I get notifications and can control it using media keys. 

- make a better search:
    - ability to add selected search track to queue (a/n)
    - search should be for entire library. kinda like on a streaming service app.
    - search for playlists as well
    - search for albums --> album view
    - search for artist --> artist view
- make a better artist/album view.
- last.fm integration
    - maybe easiest is to just write listening log to a file. another program can then read the file outside of this program's code. 
- custom symbol?
- make into an "executable" program --> idk how, just has to show up in programs as a normal program.
