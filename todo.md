# todo stuff
- Should send signals to the media player on linux. So I get notifications and can control it using media keys. 

- make a better search:
    - ability to add selected search track to queue (a/n)
    - search should be for entire library. kinda like on a streaming service app.
    - search for playlists as well
    - search for albums --> album view
    - search for artist --> artist view
- make a better artist/album view.
- last.fm integration
    - maybe easiest is to just write listening log to a file. another program can then read the file outside of this program's code. 
- custom symbol?
- make into an "executable" program --> idk how, just has to show up in programs as a normal program.

UI:
- Not a fan of the small black border between playlist items.
- The header for the left sidebar, the main content table, and the queue should all be aligned (it should look like a single horizontal line.)
- the "button-like" border/shadow around the: "media info", "playlists", and the "+" (new playlist button) headers don't look good. they look like they are painted on top of the actual UI.
- the top bar currently displays track x out of y and total playtime. It would be cool to pad it out with more stats, but it should also be done tastefully and not just to add more numbers.
